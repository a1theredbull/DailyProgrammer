Challenge from: http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/10pf4a/9302012_challenge_102_intermediate_ncharacterset/

Write a function that takes a string s and an integer n, and returns whether or not the string s contains at most n different characters.
For example, ncset("aacaabbabccc", 4) would return true, because it contains only 3 different characters, 'a', 'b', and 'c', and 3 <= 4.
For how many English words (yes, it's time for this dictionary again!) does ncset(word, 4) hold?
